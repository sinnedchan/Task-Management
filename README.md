# Real-Time Task Management App

This is a real-time task management app that uses React and Typescript. It allows users to add new tasks and update/edit tasks if required, and once the task is complete it can be deleted and removed from the task queue.

## Front-End

Front-End fuctioning as required

## Back-End

Currently not implemented, DynamoDB table has been set up, but unable to link it to front-end react component. (Lambda and API Gateway needed to setup)

## Future updates

If there were opportunities to return to this assignment, ideally back-end would be set up so that when tasks are submitted, data would be sent to DynamoDB via [POST] calls. [PATCH] calls would be used to update existing tasks and [DELETE] calls would be used to delete tasks that have been completed by the user.
